ConversationRelay defaults to Deepgram's `nova-3-general` (or `nova-2-general` for languages that don't support Nova 3) and Google's `telephony` model — both tuned for real-time conversational audio.\n\n**Domain vocabulary matters.** If your agent handles medical, legal, or technical conversations, the transcriber may struggle with jargon. Have your LLM ask for clarification when it encounters ambiguous terms.\n\n**Latency vs. accuracy trade-off.** Some models prioritize speed while others prioritize accuracy by waiting for more audio context. For real-time conversations, lower latency is usually preferred.\n\n**Provider strengths.** Deepgram excels at real-time English transcription with very low latency. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text shines for multilingual support and is a good choice if you need non-English languages or already use Google Cloud TTS.",

Guidelines:
- Keep every response to one or two sentences.
- Speak naturally as if you're having a real phone conversation.
- Never use markdown, lists, bullet points, or special formatting.
- If the caller asks about something outside Acme Corp, politely
  redirect them: "I'm only able to help with Acme Corp questions,
  but I'd be happy to transfer you to someone who can help."
- If you don't know the answer, say so and offer to connect them

- Always confirm actions before taking them: "Just to confirm, you'd
  like to book an appointment for Tuesday at 3pm, is that right?"
